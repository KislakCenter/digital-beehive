issue: The point of reference for "Temple" is not entirely clear, as there is no alphabetical
  entry for this term. The Octavo Index indicates that 183 [Temple] may be the earliest
  occurrence of this topic in the Numerical section of the Alvearium. Also, Pastorius's
  underlining makes it unclear whether the topic is "Holiness of Places & Times,"
  or simply "Holiness of."
