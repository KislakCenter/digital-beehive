issue: The point of reference for "Omission" is not clear, as there is no alphabetical
  entry for this term. The Octavo Index indicates that 268 [Omission] may be the earliest
  occurrence of this topic in the Numerical section of the Alvearium. The point of
  reference for "Forgetful" is also not entirely clear, as there is no alphabetical
  entry for this term. We linked to the alphabetical entry for "Forgetfulness."
