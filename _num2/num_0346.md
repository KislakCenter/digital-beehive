issue: The points of reference for "Bever", "Dinner" and "Breakfast" are not entirely
  clear, as there are no alphabetical entries for these terms. The Octavo Index indicates
  that 1218 [Dinner] and 1218 [Breakfast] may be the earliest occurrences of these
  topics in the Numerical section of the Alvearium. The Octavo Index indicates that
  830 [Bever] may be the earliest occurrence of this topic in the Numerical section
  of the Alvearium, but the page on which it would appear is missing from the manuscript.
