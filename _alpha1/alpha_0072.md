issue: The point of reference for "Brewing" is not entirely clear, as there is no
  alphabetical entry for this term. The Octavo Index indicates that 4615 [Brewing]
  may be the earliest ocurrence of this topic in the Numerical section of the Alvearium,
  but the page on which it would be found is missing from the manuscript.
