issue: The point of reference for "Tares" is not entirely clear, as there is no alphabetical
  entry for this term. The Octavo Index indicates that 809 [Tares] may be the  the
  earliest occurrence of this topic in the Numerical section of the Alvearium, but
  the page on which it would appear is missing from the manuscript.
