issue: The point of reference for "Neger" is not entirely clear, as there is no alphabetical
  entry for this term. The Octavo Index indicates that 382 [Neger or Negro] may be
  the earliest occurrence of this topic in the Numerical section of the Alvearium.
  It is also unclear as to whether or not "White" should be considered its own entry.
  Here we have annotated it as if it were so.
