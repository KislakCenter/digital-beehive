pastorius_description: 'For as much as our Memory is not capable to retain / all remarkable
  words, Phrases, Sentences or / Matters of moment, which we do hear and read, / It
  beseems every good Scholar to have a Common- / Place-Book, and therein to treasure
  up what- / ever deserves his Notice. &c. And to the end / that he may readily know,
  both whither to dispose / & insert each particular, as also where upon / occasion
  to find the same again, &c.  He ought to / make himself an Alphabetical Index /
  like this of mine for my English Bee-Stock / which being the largest and best Manuscript,
  / I in my riper years did gather out of the most / excellent Authors thereunto prefixed,
  would / desire my two Sons, not to part with it for any gold / or red Dust of this
  World; But rather Con- / tinue it by the help of this following Table. / Because,
  The pride of Wisdom is above Rubies, / & cannot be valued with the precious Onyx
  or / Sapphire; And to get understanding is / rather to be chosen, than Silver. &c.
  / Prov. 16:16. Job 28:16, 18. and what / wisdom & undestanding is, vid. x. 28. //
  In the following Table the letter a. stands for the alphabetical / part of the Hive
  from p.134. to p.217. and the numbers 1. 2. 3. / to above 1800. [2000.] from thence
  do orderly succeed. // One or more Figures inclosed in a Crotchet, ex. gr. [.1.]
  after the / word Overmeasure, refers you to the additions annexed to the Alphabetical
  Table. // What in the subsequent Table is alledged by p. /: signifying Page / hath
  relation chiefly to that part of my Hive, Intit''led / Emblematical Recreations,
  from p. 25. to p. 54. / as also to the several Inscriptions, from p.2. &c.'
