# Digital Beehive

This site was built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

This site uses a modified version of the [Wax](https://github.com/minicomp/wax) theme. For further information on using Wax, please read the documentation [here](https://minicomp.github.io/wiki/wax/).

You can find the datasets used to build the Digital Beehive in the \_data folder. The python scripts used to process the data and create the linked entries will be available online in the near future.
