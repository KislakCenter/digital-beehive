This section includes miscellaneous excerpts and verse in the manuscript, as well as contributions in hands other than Pastoriusâ€™s. It also includes text pertaining to the Title Deed for Land in Germantown, as well as a transcription of a parable. Some of these excerpts had been hidden between pasted pages prior to the rebinding process; others are found interleaved in unexpected contexts.
