In this section, you will find images of the “Bee-Hive” manuscript as it looked upon acquisition by the University of Pennsylvania Libraries, as well as images of its current state. In 1952, photographs were taken of the manuscript in its original binding before it was sent to be rebound in two blue goatskin bindings, with each leaf encased in cellulose acetate film. The separate octavo index remains in its own original binding, and the library has retained the original folio binding, now housed independently separately from the rebound manuscript. This section also includes the provenience and colophon found at the end of the rebound second volume.
