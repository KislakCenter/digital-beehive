The Tithe - Teacher Plaintiff & the Poor Man Defendant  

A poor man that for Conscience sake can't pay  
Tithes to the Priest, whom he has not hired, and of whom  
he never had no work done, is sum[m]oned by a Writ  
of sub poena out of the Exchequer or Chancerie to  
appear in his own person[^1] such a day on pain of a  
hundred Pound, may be two hundred miles from his home  
for a matter of a Groat or twelve Pence, &c.  
And when the poor man comes _honestly_ to the Court, there stands  
men, called Tip-staves, with great staves in their hands,  
keeps him out, & bids him go get an Attorney to  
appear for him. Then the poor man waits till the  
Judges rise, & when they come forth of the Court, tells  
them that he is come to appear in his own person  
as the Writ commands him, the Judges bids him go  
to the Office & get an Attorney:[^2] the poor man  
replies, This Writ of mine commands me, all Excuses  
set apart, to appear in my own person, and here  
I am, is not this appearance? No. Then the  
poor man goes to the Office, and tells an Attorney  
that he has appeared, and desires him to record it  
for which Recording he will give him four pence,
(:which is his due.) You must first give me ten  
groats _to appear for you,_ says the Attorney, and then I will record  
it for four pence. The poor man replies, I have  
appeared myself in my own person, & therefore it is  
a very unreasonable thing to ask me ten groats  
for work that I have done myself. That is no  
Appearance, says the Attorney, you must fee  
an Attorney, for you can't appear yourself.  
Then says the poor man, this is a false Writ,  
take it again, & make it right the next time,  
& com[m]and an Attorney to appear & discharge me.  
No, no says the Att: the Writ is true, and it is  
yours, but you must get an Attorney, to appear for you.  
My Writ does not say so, says the poor man, but  
it com[m]ands me expressly to appear in my own person.  
Well, well, says the Att: give me ten groats,  
& I will appear for you, & then I am your person.  
That can't be, says the poor man, ten groats  
can never change my person, & therefore I desire  
thee. Record my own appearance which I have made  
& that will be Truth without any Lying or dis:  
sembling, and I will pay thee for thy pains.  
But if I should record your appearance in your  
own person, says the Att: what will become  
of me and all other Attornies hereafter? Says  
an other Att: If such as you came, you may go  
hang our tools on the hedge; I have nothing  
to do with _what you do with_ your tools says the poor man, If  
you had not sent this Writ for me, I could have  
been very willing to stay at home & follow my  
work; but seeing I am not beyond Sea, nor Sick  
nor lame, nor impotent, (:In which Cases the  
law allows of Attornies,:) I thought it my duty  
to appear in my own person, as the Write com[m]ands.  
Thou art an impudent fellow, says an Att: to come  
to take away our Trade; If you will have none  
of us to appear for you, says an other Att: we  
will send an attachment for you, and com[m]it you  
to prison for a Contempt. Then if the poor  
man for fear of the pretended Contempt.  

Then if the poor  
man for fear of the pretended Contempt do fee an  
Att. then says the Att: you must answer the Bill
or else you will be in Contempt. Give me the  
Bill, says the poor man, and I'le answer it. But  
says the Att: You must first give a Rule. a Rule  
what's that? says the poor man. Give me a Groat,  
says the Att. and I will give a rule for you, for  
you can't do it yourself.  

Then the poor man gives him  
a groat, for which he writes or speaks a few words to the  
Plaintiffs Att. to bring in the Bill. Now says the Att.  
you must answer this Bill, or else you will be in Contempt.  
Give it me, says the poor man, & I'le answer to it. No, no,  
says the Att. I must take a copy of it for you, & you must  
give me eight Pence a sheet; That's very dear, says the  
poor man, and I work very hard a great while for a little money,  
& shall not part so lightly with it, but if thou wilt  
write me a Copy for so much money as I should get buying  
work while thou art writing it, I shall pay thee, for I am  
very willing to do as I would be done by. But I'le not  
do so, says the Att. for I must have 8 pence a sheet for it.  
Then says the poor man, If thou wilt not write it for a  
reasonable Price, let me see it, & I can do it myself  
or get my Friend to write it for me. No, no, says [the] Att.  
We will not let you have the Record to write a Copy of  
it your self, nor your Friend neither, you must ap:  
point an Att. to do it for you. Well then says the poor  
man, It seems I have power to appoint an Att. and with:  
out me he dare not meddle; therefore Either write it  
for me at my Price, or else let me write it myself.  
What a strange man are you! says the Att. do you  
think that we must work at the same rate as you  
work at? Why should you not? says the poor man, for  
the Scripture says, Whatsoever you would that men should  
do unto you, do ye so unto them. Well, well, says the Att.  
But my fees are due unto me by the Law of the Land.  
It's true indeed, says the poor man, there was a Statute made  
in the 7th year of king Richard the 2nd which says, that Att.  
in the absence of their Masters may answer for them; And  
therefore of being Master am willing to give thee as much  
as I can get myself, and me thinks thou shouldst be Content  
with it, for I'm glad to work for two pence half penny  
an hour, that is half a Crown a day, and I think that is  
good honest wages, & if thou wilt not work as cheap as I do,  
I being thy Master, let me do my work my self.  

But says the Att. my Parents bred me up to this, & it cost  
them a great deal of money, & me a great deal of time,  
before I got anything for myself, then how do you  
think my labour should be as cheap as yours? Well,  
says the poor man; My Parents also bred me up, & gave  
money to bind me. Apprentice, and so I serv'd Seven years  
before I got for myself, then reckon my money be my time  
as well as thy money by thy time, & now why should not my  
labour be as good as thine? And further I ask thee, by  
what law thou demandest eight pence a sheet? It's the  
Rules of the Court, says the Att. & also an ancient  
Custom. I have heard some say, says the poor Man,  
that it is a Maxime in Law, that an evil Custom is to  
be abolished, & truly I think it a very bad Custom  
that would compel me to pay an Att. 8 pence a sheet[^3]  
& have so few words there in, that a Lawyer or his  
boy can write nine sheets of it in an hour, how canst  
thou in Conscience ask me five or six shillings for  
every hours writing? And when thou hast done, I  
could write as much my self in one Sheet as thou  
doest write in twenty. Besides when thou hirest  
an other man to write the same for thee, thou givest  
him but a Penny a Sheet, and wouldn't thou have 8 pence  
of me this is Contrary to Equity & good Conscience,  
Moreover Magna Charta says, We will sell no  
man Justice nor Right; and therefore I am very  
hardly used, if I can have neither, except I buy it  
at such a dear rate. Well, well, says the Att. If  
you will not take a Copy of the Bill, and put in  
an Answer; it will be a Contempt.  

Then if the  
Poor Man take a Copy of the Bill at this unrea:  
sonable rate for fear of a Contempt, and having per:  
us'd it, he tells the Lawyer, there is many things in  
this Bill that is not true[^4] & asks why they put such  
things in? This is our Formality, says the Att.  
Then your Formality lyes, says the poor man, &c.  
Whereupon he writes a plain answer, & brings it  
to the lawyer, and says, here I have brought my  
Answer to the Bill. This is no Answer, says the  
Att. You must go to a Counsellor & get him to write  
an answer for you. Why should I do so? says the poor  
man, must I answer the Bill or the Counsellor? No, says  
the Att. you must answer the Bill, but you must get a Coun:  
cellor to write it according to Law, & put his hand to it.  
I can answer myself, says the poor man, & put mine own  
hand to it; And why should not that be taken, Seeing I am  
the man that is com[m]anded by the Law to answer?  
If you do not get your answer with the Counsellor's hand  
to it, says the Att. it will be a Contempt.  

Then if the  
poor man for fear of a Contempt do go to a Counsellor, he  
must first give him his fee,[^5] if an Ordinary Counsellor, may  
be ten Shillings will serve, but if he be a great one, which  
is gotten to the degree of the Coife, or a Sergeant at Law,  
it must be more, and so he writes an Answer, dressing it  
finely with many Lawyers words, sch. the poor man  
knows not what they mean, and thus the Answer gets  
a new face & becomes such a one as pleaseth the Coun:  
cellor, whether it pleaseth the poor mans own Con:  
science or not, the Case is already taken. And if the poor  
man be consciencious, & would plead honestly according to  
the Scriptures & the righteous Laws of this Nation, then [the]  
Councellor will not put his hand to it; So in very Truth  
it is the Councellors Answer in in the poor mans name, and  
if the poor man will not put in such an Answer, it  
is called a Contempt.  

When all this is done, the poor man  
must bring this the Councellors Answer to his Attorney  
to ingross it in Parchment, for which he must pay,  
and then go before a Master, if it be in Chancerie  
or before a Baron, if it be in the Exchequer; and be  
Sworn to that Answer, giving him t. pence. But  
if the poor man declares,[^6] that he will keep Christ's  
Commandment: Swear Not At All, then neither Master  
nor Baron will take his Answer, but chide him,[^7] &  
frown upon him, (and says one) if you will not Swear,  
we swear, & if you will not swear, you shall go to Prison  
for a Contempt. Shew me that Law, says the poor man,  
commands me to swear to mine Answer. We know  
a Law, says the Baron, though you do not. [    ] then,  
says the poor man, when that Law was made [   ]?  
By whom, that I may read it, for the Law of England  
is to be read to the People four times a year [     ]  
County, as appears by the 28. year of King Edward I.  
Yes you gone Sirrah (saith Baron Nicholas:)  
[    ], if you come before me again, I will lay  
you by the heels.  

Then if the poor man for  
fear of a Contempt or Prison do Swear to his Answer,  
his Att. tells him there will be Replication,  
& I must take a Copy of it for you, & you must give  
me 8 pence a Sheet. When the poor man reads it  
he finds an ill favoured thing, & tells his Att. This  
is not true. This is our Formality says the Att.  
Then your Formalities are lies, says the poor man. Well,  
well, says the Att. Now you must put in a [Re     ]  
to this Replicaon. What's that! says the poor man,  
Give me money, says the Att. & I'le put it in for you,  
you can't do it yourself. &c. And many such [vile]  
dirty things as these he calls to the poor man for money for.  

After all this the poor man is served with an other  
Writ Com[m]anding him to appear in his own Person to hear  
Judgment,[^8] and when his name is call'd, he answers,  
Here I am,  Where's your Counsellor? says the Judges.  
I am here myself, says the poor man; But you must  
have a Counsellor, to plead for you, says the Judges.  
Is this Cause mine, or is it a Councels? says the poor man.  
No, it is your Cause, says the Judges and Lawyers. Well  
then, says the poor man, If the Cause be mine, then  
hear me; For the righteous Law of God, and the just  
Law of England com[m]and the Judges to hear [the] poor  
as well as the rich without [repent] of Persons, &c.  
If you'le not have Counsel, says the Judge, your Cause  
will suffer. I am sure says the poor man, a Counsellor  
can't plead my Cause, except he have Instruction from  
me what to plead, and therefore if I am able to in:  
struct a Counsellor what to plead, I'm able to plead my  
Cause myself, For Greater is the Teacher, than he that  
is taught, &c. But says the Judge, you may be ingo:  
rant of the Law for all this & therefore you must  
have Counsel. But says the poor man, If I know  
my cause myself as the matter of fact, you the Judge,  
are to inform me if I mistake, in matter of Law,  
for that end are you set there Judges.  

Nevertheless the poor man being Overruled & dri:  
ven to put his cause into a Counsels hand, then be:  
tween the Councel & the Judges they can make  
the poor mans Cause look how they please, and the  
poor man shall have no more Law, but just so much  
as they're pleased to measure him out; and if he  
that pleads for him be but an Ordinary Counsellor, he  
will have 20 shillings, if not 30. but if he be a  
Serjeant at Law or Coife man, 40 shillings a fee.  
Then if the poor mans cause be cast, if it be  
matter of Imprisonment, the poor man must go  
to prison, & neither Attorney nor Councel will  
go for him thither, nor give him his money again.  
In few words there's the poor mans fate; the poor  
man pays for all, and suffers for all, and the  
Lawyers go away with all, and the poor man must  
stand by, and see himself rob'd of his Birthright.  

And now all sober People Consider, it [ ] be not  
agt. Law & Reason to be Compelled to Come to a Court  
& when one comes must not do his own work work himself  
but must (whether he will or no) hire other men to  
do it & pay them at a very high rate, giving them  
more money for one days work than he himself  
can get in ten: And if they spoil his work  
yet they will not give him his money again.  
Now is not this far worse than any manual Ocu:  
pation? As for example, if a man go to a Joyners  
Shop or the like, and bid the Master make him  
a Bedstead, & give him his money before hand,  
if the Joyners tools be naught, & he spoil it in  
making, will not the man object, as very well he  
may, that the Joyner shall make him a good bed  
stead, fit for his use and stand to the boss of the  
law: one himself or else return the man his money  
and if no, why should not the Lawyers trie the poor  
mans Cause again at their own Charge till the [   ]  
it, [   ] or else return the man his money, & let him  
either seek better workmen, or do his work him  
self next time.

[^2]: How can I or you say, that I appeared in mine own person, / When the Att appears for me? And so I make you lyers, / and myself both in this Case. O lamentable! here is / no Truth neither in Priests nor Judges. Lord help me, for / thou art Just, and judgest righteously among the Gods. G. Fox In.  

[^3]: It may be the Sheet does not consist of above sixteen lines.

Fox Instruct [         ] Indictment Num. 1163  

[^5]: Ah! says the poor man, You are all for for money, I am / for Justice; I know Reason & unreasonableness and by / that means can plead my own Cause. G.

[^6]: Here the poor man must break Christs Com[m]and, and deny / himself to be a Christian, and become like them, a Swearer.  

[^7]: Will he not Swear? Cries the fierce and furious Judge, Take / him away, cast him into the Prison or into the fleet. / And if he will not give the Priest tithes, take treble dam: / mage of him, and then wreck him. And so the Priest / whose Conscience is feared, takes treble and treble, as you / may read in the book called The Sufferings about Tithes. / Alack for you, says the poor man, how can you give the Priest / treble dam[m]age of me according to Reason, on which the / Law is grounded? I owe him nothing, I never hired him & he / has done no work for me; neither is he my Teacher, Christ / is my Teacher; neither is he my Priest, Christ is my Priest; / & neither is he my Bishop, Christ is my Bishop. &c.

Ah! cryes the poor Prisoner, doth the / hat destroy Government & Ministry both? doth it all end in / the hat? doth a hat make such a work with you? You / ought to do Justice without respect of persons, or without / respect of a hat, &c. G. Fox d. 3.
