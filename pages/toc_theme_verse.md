This section includes all parts of the “Bee-Hive” in which Pastorius crafts his own poetry or records poems from others. The majority of his poetry can be found in his Germantown Silva, the most multilingual space in the “Bee-Hive”, in which Pastorius writes verse in his native German, low Dutch, French, and Latin, as well as of course in English, the main language of the “Bee-Hive”. This section also includes epigrams and miscellaneous verse from throughout the manuscript.
