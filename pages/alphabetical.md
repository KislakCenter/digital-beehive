The following pages present high quality scans of the Alphabetical Section of Pastorius's Beehive Manuscript with relevant metadata for each entry.

The **Alphabetical Section** forms the first part of Pastorius's **_Alvearium_**. The _Alvearium_ contains individual entries for ideas and concepts, like the entries in an encyclopedia. However, unlike an encyclopedia, the purpose of these entries is not to define the concept but to flesh out its semantic context. To this end, each entry contains cross-references to other entries in the _Alvearium_. These cross-references map relationships of meanings between words and are presented in the Digital Beehive as a hyperlink in the case that the intended point of reference can be identified. The content of the entries is the product of Pastorius's commonplacing and draws from the books listed in the [book list]({{ site.baseurl }}/book-list/).

The Alphabetical Section comprises the last folios of volume one (images 431 through 456) and the first folios of volume two (images 11 through 67). Entries in the Alphabetical Section are arranged approximately in alphabetical order. The Digital Beehive preserves Pastorius's ordering and does not correct when an entry appears out of its strict alphabetical order. Entries may additionally be found using the [search function]({{ site.baseurl }}/search/), or by browsing the [Octavo Index]({{ site.baseurl }}/index/).

Basic annotation of the Alphabetical Section was completed in August 2019.
