This page presents the third known version of front matter for the Beehive. Although chronologically the last version, it is located at the beginning of volume one, on images 11 to 17. It includes at least two title pages, several epigraphs, and other material explaining the manuscript's project.

Note the versioning of Pastorius's front matter remains a hypothesis.
