Almost every section of the “Bee-Hive” includes its own index for locating information. All of the indices are included here as they are found in the “Bee-Hive” Folio. Additionally, the Alvearium has a second version of its index, which bears the name “Octavo Index” as it is a separate octavo volume. This index has been fully annotated.
