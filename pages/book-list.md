title: Books from the Beehive

---

N. B. _This transcription of the book list was prepared by Lyman Riley, a former Curator of Special Collections at the University of Pennsylvania Libraries. It has been OCRed and formatted into a table for readability. Riley also prepared an [Introduction](riley.md) to the book list._

Below are the standard catalogues used in identifying the Beehive books, with the short forms that appear in the footnotes. Further attempts to find listings may be made by examining other sources, and, also, by trying again to interpret the sometimes puzzling way titles are recorded by Pastorius. Some other cases lacking a record are because of the difficulty of deciphering the handwriting.

### Pag 56<sup>1st</sup> _Quakers_

Forasmuch as the Old Index, beginning formerly at this Side, was not only too Compact, being pressed together in the narrow Bounds of three Pages, but also defective & without true Alphabetical Order, &c. I at the latter Renewal or Renivation [sic] of this Manuscript (: whereof it is never like to have any more, having had enough already:) thought it more Convenient & Suitable to those hands that will accomplish this Alvearium, to Remove the said unhandsom [sic] & vitious Table, by tearing the same, and present a better & Compleater at the very Entrance or Threshold of this Book, to which I refer the inquisitive Reader for his more satisfactory Content. And Whereas (: as Plinius saith

In genuum est Fateri per Quos profeceris, I shall set down the several Authors, Out of which this present Hive is collected. #

And ye, John Samuel & Henry Pastorius, dear & well beloved children!

At Leasure hours and Candle-light,  
When others play, or lose their Sight,  
Read ye these Books I here have set,  
Or other good ones, you can get.  
  See pag. 375.376.377.378.379.380  
But where you meet an Asterisk\*  
Think that your Father, being brisk,  
Perused them, and like a Bee  
From thence did gather what you see.  
In hoc Alveario, Favis multifario  
Non sibi, Sed vobis Mellificavit Apis,  
sive potius Apicula Germanopolitana. F.D.P.

Books in folio, quarto, octavo, duodecimo,  
broad—side.

Out of the Writings of those true Christians whom the World in Scorn calls Quakers, which harmless Name this harmless People cannot but own. _add p. 375.376._

Of making of Books there's never no End,  
And many good hours in reading we spend;  
The Purpose whereof for ever should be,  
For Writers to teach: for Readers to see  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to fear the Lord,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to keep His Word. Eccl. 12:12, 13.

[And adjacent to the foregoing]

But Reader, Of these Two, care more for WHAT, than WHO.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non tum Quis dicat, quam Quid dicatur odora.</a>
As we are not to look at the Vessel or Instrument by or through  
them it may please God to Convey something for our edification,  
so as to Overvalue its gifts, parts, & Endowments, though never  
so excellent. At the other hand we ought to take care, not to  
disregard, slight, or despise any thing mediatel handed forth  
from God, because of the meanness of the Instrum , Seeing it's  
He alone that workes [sic] all in All.
