        As Pastorius continually added to the "Bee-Hive", he reworked the introductory material, adding new versions of the front matter instead of replacing the old ones. The various version of this material can be found here, in addition to the front matter for his separate Octavo Index. Please note that the versioning of this content is a work in progress. <br />

        <br />
        <strong>COMING SOON:</strong> Former curator at the University of Pennsylvania, Lyman W. Riley, created a typescript version of the book list that is shelved with the manuscript at the Kislak Center (<a href= '{{ site.baseurl }}/bibliography'>see Riley</a>), University of Pennsylvania Libraries. The website will soon include a machine-readable, OCR'd version of this document.<br/>

        The Alvearium of the “Bee-Hive” can be divided, arbitrarily, into two sections. The first part consists of an alphabetical listing of terms. These terms touch upon a wide variety of topics, including religion, ethics, governance, agriculture, the natural world, literature, and language.  After Pastorius exhausts the space he allotted for his “Alphabetical Hive,” he includes “Additions.” This section merely continues his “Alphabetical Hive” under a different organizational principle. These additions far outnumber the entries organized alphabetically. Here we refer to this additions as the “Numerical Section.” In this section, Pastorius abandons his alphabetical organization of terms and assigns each term a number. Numbers are then arranged in ascending order. <br />
        <br />
        The linked entries for the Alphabetical Section have already been completed, and can be explored <a href= '{{ site.baseurl }}/alphabetical'>here</a>. <br />

        The entries for the Numerical Section are currently being completed, and will be added to the website in small sections. The first available section can be viewed <a href= '{{ site.baseurl }}/numerical'>here</a>. <br />

        In this section, Pastorius collects inscriptions found on myriad surfaces as various as sun-dials, tennis-courts, statues and private dwelling-houses  "gather'd out of [his own] Itinerary." This likely refers to another of his manuscripts entitled Itinerarium, which recounts a Grand Tour of Western Europe Pastorius took as a tutor to young nobleman Johann Bonaventura von Bodeck from 1690 to 1692 (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/bibliography/">see Learned, <i>Life</i> p. 90</a>). <br />

        In this section, Pastorius presents a "recollection" (from memory) of examples of emblems he has encountered in his travels, following a conventional delineation of precepts for these "Speaking Pictures." Instead of providing direct pictorial recollections, he pairs illustrative verbal descriptions with mottos, organized in a wide breadth of categories. <br />

        This section includes all parts of the "Bee-Hive" in which Pastorius crafts his own poetry. The majority of his poetry can be found in his Germantown Silva, the most multi-lingual space in the "Bee-Hive", in which Pastorius writes verse in his native German, low Dutch, French, and Latin, as well as of course in English, the main language of the "Bee-Hive". This section also includes epigrams and miscellaneous verse from throughout the folio. <br />

        In this section, you will find images of the "Bee-Hive" manuscript as it looked upon acquisition by the University of Pennsylvania Libraries, as well as images of its current state. In 1952, photographs were taken of the manuscript in its original binding before it was sent to be rebound in two blue goatskin bindings, with each leaf encased in cellulose acetate film. The separate octavo index remains in its own original binding, and the library has retained the original folio binding, now housed independently separately from the rebound manuscript. This section also includes the provenience and colophon found at the end of the rebound second volume. <br />
