description: Navigating the "Bee-Hive" by Section

---

This section provides a means for viewing the Beehive section by section. As Pastorius worked on the Beehive, he reordered and renumbered leaves in the Beehive, adding in new leaves as he needed them and moving existing leaves to accommodate the new structure. Pastorius sometimes would work to keep a section of related material together, but other times, he would divide the material. This means that two parts of one section can sometimes be found at two different points in the manuscript. It can thus be difficult to find material in the Beehive through a page-by-page interface alone.

The Section Browse feature allows the user to view all pages from a given section in the Beehive. Sections are defined in varying degrees of granularity. For example, it is possible to see all introductory material, or to isolate just one version of introductory material. Pastorius's own language, where it exists, has been preserved to describe sections. As the Digital Beehive Team has only annotated a small portion of these sections, the explanatory language provided now is provisional and based on the team's developing knowledge of the manuscript.

The [Alphabetical Hive]({{ site.baseurl }}/alphabetical) of the Alvearium has been annotated fully, as has the [Octavo Index]({{ site.baseurl }}/index) to the Alvearium. The Digital Beehive Team is currently working on annotating the [Numerical Additions]({{ site.baseurl }}/numerical) to the Alvearium. These sections can be viewed here in a page-by-page fashion, or as linked entries.

#### [Introductory Material](toc_theme_introductory_material.md)

As Pastorius continually added to the "Bee-Hive", he reworked the **introductory material**, adding new **versions** of the **front matter** instead of replacing the old ones. The various version of this material can be found here, in addition to the front matter for his separate Octavo Index. Please note that the versioning of this content is a work in progress.  

#### [Indices](toc_theme_indices.md)

Almost every section of the "Bee-Hive" includes its own **index** for **locating information**. All of the indices are included here as they are found in the "Bee-Hive" Folio. Additionally, the Alvearium has a second version of its index, which bears the name ["Octavo Index"]({{ site.baseurl }}/index) as it is a separate octavo volume. This index has been fully annotated.  

#### [Book List](toc_theme_book_list.md)

This section includes all of the **book lists** Pastorius compiled in the "Bee-Hive", including a **list of his own manuscripts**. He primarily divdes these lists under **"Quaker"** and **"No Quaker,"** and additions to this list are found within the pages of the Alvearium. <br />

Former curator at the University of Pennsylvania, Lyman W. Riley, created a [typescript version]({{ site.baseurl }}/books-from-the-beehive) of the book list that is shelved with the manuscript at the Kislak Center at the University of Pennsylvania Libraries. The website includes a machine-readable, [OCRed version]({{ site.baseurl }}/books-from-the-beehive) of this document.

#### [Alvearium](toc_theme_alvearium.md)

The Alvearium of the “Bee-Hive” can be arbitrarily divided into two sections. The **Alphabetical Section** consists of an alphabetical **listing of terms**. These terms touch upon a wide variety of topics, including religion, ethics, governance, agriculture, the natural world, literature, and language.  After Pastorius exhausted the space he allotted for his “Alphabetical Hive,” he begins the **Numerical Section**. This section merely continues his “Alphabetical Hive” under a different organizational principle. In this section, Pastorius abandons his alphabetical organization of terms and **assigns each term a number**. Numbers are then arranged in ascending order.

The [linked entries for the Alphabetical Section]({{ site.baseurl }}/alphabetical) have already been completed.

The [entries for the Numerical Section]({{ site.baseurl }}/numerical) are currently being completed, and will be added to the website in small sections.

#### [Inscriptions](toc_theme_inscriptions.md)

In this section, Pastorius collects **inscriptions** found on **existing structures** as various as sun-dials, tennis-courts, statues and private dwelling-houses  "**gather'd out of [his own] Itinerary**." This likely refers to another of his manuscripts entitled Itinerarium, which recounts a Grand Tour of Western Europe Pastorius took as a tutor to young nobleman Johann Bonaventura von Bodeck from 1690 to 1692, [see Learned, _Life_, 90]({{ site.baseurl }}/bibliography).

#### [Emblematical Recreations](toc_theme_emblematical_recreations.md)

In this section, Pastorius presents a "recollection" (from memory) of examples of **emblems** he has encountered in his travels, following a conventional delineation of precepts for these "Speaking Pictures." Instead of providing direct pictorial recollections, he pairs **illustrative verbal descriptions with mottos**, organized in a wide breadth of **categories**.

#### [Onomastical Considerations](toc_theme_onomastical_considerations.md)

In this section, fundamentally structured as a piece of **continuous prose** divided into **discrete numbered sections** that allow for a variety of cross-references and insertions, Pastorius considers **naming conventions** in a variety of senses and contexts.

#### [Verse](toc_theme_verse.md)

This section includes all parts of the "Bee-Hive" in which Pastorius crafts **his own poetry**. The majority of his poetry can be found in his Germantown Silva, the most **multilingual** space in the "Bee-Hive", in which Pastorius writes verse in his native German, low Dutch, French, and Latin, as well as of course in English, the main language of the "Bee-Hive". This section also includes **epigrams** and **miscellaneous verse** from throughout the manuscript.

#### [Onomastic Symbols](toc_theme_onomastic_symbols.md)

These symbols, essentially **short phrases**, are almost entirely based on **Pastorius's intials**, F.D.P. This section is dispersed throughout the entire folio, leaf by leaf, and are **numbered** to provide order that their placement in the folio lacks.  

#### [Epitaphs](toc_theme_epitaphs.md)

This section, culled from another of Pastorius's manuscripts (his Liber (here Libello) Epitaphiorum), presents a collection of **epitaphs** recorded and recollected from his various **travels.**

#### [Genealogy](toc_theme_genealogy.md)

In this section, Pastorius provides his own **genealogical history.** The "Bee-Hive" was kept in the **Pastorius family** until its arrival at the University of Pennsylvania in 1949. This is only section that they continued to fill out, and thus it includes **entries in others' hands**.

#### [Miscellania](toc_theme_miscellania.md)

This section includes **miscellaneous excerpts and verse** in the manuscript, as well as contributions in **hands other than Pastorius's**. It also includes text pertaining to the Title Deed for Land in Germantown, as well as a transcription of a parable. Some of these excerpts had been hidden between pasted pages prior to the rebinding process; others are found interleaved in unexpected contexts.  

#### [Blank Pages](toc_theme_blank_pages.md)

In this section, you will find a collection of all of the **blank pages** in the "Bee-Hive" folio and separate octavo index. These leaves are found throughout the manuscript, and these high-quality scans are provide a glimpse into their variability and the **paper** itself.

#### [The Book's Physical Properties](toc_theme_books_properties.md)

In this section, you will find images of the "Bee-Hive" manuscript as it looked **upon acquisition** by the University of Pennsylvania Libraries, as well as images of its **current state**. In 1952, photographs were taken of the manuscript in its original binding before it was sent to be rebound in two blue goatskin bindings, with each leaf encased in cellulose acetate film. The separate octavo index remains in its own original binding, and the library has retained the **original folio binding**, now housed independently separately from the rebound manuscript. This section also includes the **provenience and colophon** found at the end of the rebound second volume.
