The following pages present high quality scans of the Octavo Index of Pastorius' Beehive Manuscript with relevant metadata for each entry.

The **Octavo Index** is a separately bound volume of the Beehive that assists in navigating the [Alphabetical]({{ site.baseurl }}/alphabetical/) and [Numerical]({{ site.baseurl }}/numerical/) Sections of the _Alvearium_. The _Alvearium_ contains individual entries for ideas and concepts, like the entries in an encyclopedia. However, unlike an encyclopedia, the purpose of these entries is not to define the concept but to flesh out its semantic context. Entries in the Alphabetical Section are arranged in approximate alphabetical order, while each entry in the Numerical Section is randomly assigned a number. Entries are then arranged in numerical order.

Each index header in the Octavo Index lists corresponding entries in the _Alvearium_. If an alphabetical entry is referenced, Pastorius writes an "a." If a numerical entry is referenced, Pastorius gives the number. Note that the index is not comprehensive. Many entries in the numerical section are not referenced at all in the Octavo Index. The Digital Beehive Team operates under the assumption that Pastorius deliberately excluded entries and therefore only supplies those entries Pastorius lists. If it can be determined which entry Pastorius intended to refer to, the entry is provided as a hyperlink.

The Octavo Index lists terms in approximate alphabetical order. The Digital Beehive preserves Pastorius's order and does not correct when a term is not in strict alphabetical order. The user may also find index headers using the [search function]({{ site.baseurl }}/search/).

Note that while annotation of the Alphabetical Section is complete, annotation of the Numerical Section is ongoing. For numerical entries that have been annotated, the link will direct the user to the annotated entry with corresponding metadata. For entries that have not been annotated, the link will direct the user to the page in the Beehive on which the entry can be found.

The Octavo Index also contains references to other parts of the Beehive besides the _Alvearium_. For page references, indicated by "p.", the Digital Beehive provides a link to the corresponding page in the Beehive in the case that it can be determined. For cross-references within the index, indicated by "s." (see) or "add.", the Digital Beehive provides a link to the corresponding index header.

Annotation of the Octavo Index was completed in August 2019. The Octavo Index supersedes an older index to the _Alvearium_, which is located at the beginning of volume one (images 18 through 34). Note that the entries referenced in the old index occasionally differ from those referenced in the Octavo Index. The Digital Beehive Team plans to annotate the Old Alvearium Index once data entry for the Numerical Section is complete (projected by the end of 2021).
