In this section, Pastorius collects inscriptions found on existing structures as various as sun-dials, tennis-courts, statues and private dwelling-houses. He collected these inscriptions while on a Grand Tour of Western Europe he took as a tutor to young nobleman Johann Bonaventura von Bodeck from 1690 to 1692.
