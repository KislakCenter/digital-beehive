Francis Daniel Pastorius's commonplace book, usually referred to as the Beehive Manuscript, is a compendium and alphabetical digest of knowledge including inscriptions, epitaphs, proverbs, poetry, Biblical citations, theological citations, quotations, a list of books he read or knew, copies of letters, and notes on science, useful herbs and other plants. The Beehive Manuscript, [Ms. Codex 726](https://franklin.library.upenn.edu/catalog/FRANKLIN_9924875473503681) in the University of Pennsylvania's [Kislak Center](https://www.library.upenn.edu/kislak), arrived at Penn in 1948 bound as one massive folio with a smaller Octavo index. The folio underwent restoration and was newly bound into two volumes. The octavo index remains in its original binding.

The Digital Beehive seeks to create a digital representation of the Beehive manuscript. Much like Pastorius's own Hive, this Digital Hive is a work in progress and will continue to grow and expand.
