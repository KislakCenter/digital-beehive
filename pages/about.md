The Digital Beehive is a web interface that serves as both a digital representation and host of digital tools for researching and working with Francis Daniel Pastorius’s "Bee-Hive" manuscript and its system of cross-referencing. This Early Modern form of pen-and-paper hyperlinking lends itself naturally to a web interface and becomes exceptionally more navigable and discoverable in digital form. In order to create such an interface, the Digital Beehive project employs a small team to both develop and utilize various protocols for creating data and metadata for each of these honey-combed entries, both replicating their physical presence in the actual manuscript as well as creating a dynamic interface that allows users to follow and aggregate Pastorius’s own system of cross-references. The Digital Beehive thus lies at the nexus of manuscript studies and digital humanities. Not quite an aggregated database nor a digital edition, this project pushes our understanding of the digital humanities in new directions, as our datasets ultimately serve to replicate, reveal, and share a hyperlinked data system developed by a single author in the Early Modern period in manuscript form. The project is continually guided by a central question: How do digital formats faithfully replicate pre-digital data systems?

#### Pastorius and his "Paper-Hive"

In 1696, Francis Daniel Pastorius, the founder of Germantown in Pennsylvania, began work on an English-language commonplace manuscript, which he called his “Bee-Hive.” The manuscript, [Ms. Codex 726](https://franklin.library.upenn.edu/catalog/FRANKLIN_9924875473503681) in the University of Pennsylvania’s [Kislak Center](https://www.library.upenn.edu/kislak), arrived at Penn in 1948 bound as one massive folio with a smaller Octavo index. The folio underwent restoration and was newly bound into two volumes. The octavo index remains in its original binding.

The manuscript's contents reveal a compendium and alphabetical digest of knowledge including inscriptions, epitaphs, proverbs, poetry, Biblical citations, theological citations, quotations, a list of books he read or knew, copies of letters, and notes on science, useful herbs and other plants. The complexities of Pastorius’s beehive metaphor are interwoven throughout the entire work, as he refines and redefines the ways in which the physical construction of a beehive informs the construction of his own “Paper-Hive.” For Pastorius, documenting his source materials in a book list, itself an impressive catalogue of printed materials available in Early America, was only the first step in the construction of the manuscript. In his hive metaphor, these books serve as flowers, the quotations he collects, pollen. His commonplacing reveals the work of the hive. The quotations are interwoven conceptually into discrete honeycombs, each of which is explicitly linked to other semantically relevant combs.

Much like Pastorius's own "Bee-Hive," the Digital Beehive is a work in progress and will continue to grow and expand.
