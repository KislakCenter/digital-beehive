#### Section Overview

The **Numerical Section** forms the second part of Pastorius's **_Alvearium_**. The _Alvearium_ contains individual entries for ideas and concepts, like the entries in an encyclopedia. However, unlike an encyclopedia, the purpose of these entries is not to define the concept but to flesh out its semantic context. To this end, each entry contains cross-references to other entries in the _Alvearium_. These cross-references map relationships of meanings between words and are presented in the Digital Beehive as a hyperlink in the case that the intended point of reference can be identified. The content of the entries is the product of Pastorius's commonplacing and draws from the books listed in the [book list]({{ site.baseurl }}/book-list/).

The Numerical Section comprises the majority of volume two. Each entry in the Numerical Section is assigned a number and entries are arranged in numerical order. The number assigned to an entry is arbitrary. Pastorius will occasionally assign two or more different topics to a single number. For this reason, entries are referred to using both their entry number and their topic. The Digital Beehive preserves Pastorius's ordering and does not correct when Pastorius makes an error in numbering. The numerical arrangement of this section can make locating information difficult. For this reason, the user may also wish to use the [search function]({{ site.baseurl }}/search/), or to  browse the alphabetically arranged [Octavo Index]({{ site.baseurl }}/index/).

#### Section Status

Annotation of the Numerical Section is currently in progress. The Numerical Section contains well over 2500 entries in total. As of November 2019, we have annotated the Numerical Section through entry 496. By March 2020, we expect to reach entry 900. We expect basic annotation of the Numerical Section to be completed by the end of 2021.
