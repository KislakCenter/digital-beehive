pastorius_description: 'The Alvearium itself, being the chief Bulk of this manuscript,
  begins pag. 231. / The Title Page thereof, see pag. 1. 54 & 55. / Some thing by
  Way of a Preface to the Peruse. Ã¿sdem pag. / The Index or Inventory was once on
  pag. 56. But a more handsom & compleater Table thou wilt find just before these
  seven leaves. / The Authors, out of w. It is collected. pag. 56. 57. 58. 59. 60.
  61. 62. // Some Inscriptions transcribed out of my Itinerary. pag. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.
  7. 8. 9. 10. / Some Epitaphs out of my Te moneant Lector tot in uno funera libro.
  Tempere quid certo  Tu quoq'' funus eris pag. 11. &c. // Emblematical Recreations
  from pag. 25. to pag. 54. / Symbola Onomastica F. D. P. pag. 55.1st. / Onomastical
  Considerations pag. 88. and so on to page 260. / Poetical Raptures pag. 71 to page

  &c. // Genelogia Pastoriana. pag. 220.2d./. // a Catalogue of mine other Manuscripts.
  pag. 386 wch. are neither for the most learned, nor the most unlearned, and where
  unto I desire none bus a Friendly & Impartial Reader. a Bee & not a Spider. ///
  At the first undertaking of this Book my mean Scope was for the future Imitation
  of my two Sons, onely to Collect Common Proverbs, witty Sentences, wise and godly
  Sayings, with the like substantial marrow of other Men''s Writings, &c. See pag.
  55 / But afterwards Considering the Copiousness of Words, Phrases & Expressions
  in the English (: my said two Sons Country-language, For seeing I and my Wife are
  both Germans, I dare not well call it their Mother Tongue, which they if possible
  should perfectly learn TO Read & Write to To Indite, I took as much pains & patience
  as to Import into the Alphabetical Alvearium all & singular Terms, Idioms, Man[n]ers
  of Stile & Speech used in the same. Now In as much the former is to supply the place
  of honey, these latter I would have to be accounted if not for Wax, yet for hivedross.
  &c. See pag. seq. / The Language now a days spoken in England & Colonies thereunto
  belonging is not the ancient Briton-Tongues, No, not the least Offspring thereof;
  But a Mingle-mangle of Latin, Dutch & French: Relicks or Remains of the Roman, Saxon
  & Norman Conquests. / Most Mono Syllables are of a Dutch origin, ax, ox, fox, cow,
  corn, horn, hard, drink, spin. &c. Words of Many Syllables are either brought in
  by the Romans, multitude, audacious, implicate, prudently, or by the Normans, buckler,
  strange, dangerous, delay, advance, maintain. &c. / And besides those there are
  also Hebrew, Arabick, Greek, Italian, Spanish, Danish and Welch words in the said
  English Tongues. See my Miscellany Remarks Concerning it pag. 151. / Hence it is
  that when other Europians can not deliver their minds but by expressing one thing
  by one word, ye English may do it Commonly by two; Oftentimes by three or four.
  - ex. gr. Spirit, Ghost, grateful, thankful. alterable, mutable, changeable. breadth,
  latitude. Sepulchre, tomb, grave. a Count, Eart, Grave. Promote, advance, further.
  Remission, pardon, forgiveness. bad, ill, naught. Impediment, obstruction, lett,
  hindrance, stop. aquit, exonerate, dischage, free. Congregation, Meeting, Gathering,
  assembling, Coming together. &c. More Examples the hive itself furnisheth almost
  in every Cranny! Therefore ye I. S. P. and H. P. for whose sake It is made, Read
  the same over & over and & over, But not overly; Mind What and How you are reading.
  / add p. 55.# / Venturag hyemis memores astate Laborem Ne fugite!  E / Quod Natura
  negat Vobis Industria praestet. / F. D. P. // For Six-corner''d hole in honey-combs.'
