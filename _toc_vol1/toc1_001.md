pastorius_description: 'For as much as our Memory is not capable to retain all remarkable
  Words, Phrases, Sciences & Makers of Moment, which we do hear and read, It becomes
  every good Scholar to have a Common-Place Book, & therein to Treasure up what ever
  deserves his Notice &c. And to the end that he may readily know, both whither to
  dispose and Insert each particular, as also where upon occasion to find the same
  again, &c. And to the end that he may readily know, both to find the same again,
  &c. he ought to make himself an Alphabetical Index, like that of this Bee-Hive beginning
  infrà page 10 ./. And Seeing it is the largest of my Manuscripts, whch I in my riper
  Years did gather out of excellent English Authors, whose Names ye may see page 56.
  &c. My desire, Last Will and Testament is, that my Two Sons John Samuel and Henry
  Pastorius shall have & hold the same with the Rest of my Writings, mentioned infrà
  page 386. to themselves & their heirs for ever, and not to part with them for any
  thing in this World, but rather to add thereunto some of their Own, &c. Because
  the price of Wisdom is above Rubies, and cannot be Valued with the precious Onyx
  or Sapphire: and to get Understanding is rather to be chosen than Silver and Gold.
  &c. / Prov. 16:16. Job. 28:16, 18. / Francis Daniel Pastorius '
