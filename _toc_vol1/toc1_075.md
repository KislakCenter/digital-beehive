pastorius_description: 'Emblems are so called ἀπὸ τοῦ ἐμβάλλειν from inserting or
  putting in. For whatsoever is laid in embroidered, checkered or engraved of many
  pieces of divers. Colours may properly be called an Emblem, But metaphorically (:
  or in a figurative manner of Speech :) Emblems signify Mottos or Devices, which
  point at a mystical or hidden Sense of certain Pictures ~ And so there must be first
  a Body, viz: a fair representation; secondly the soul, to give life to the body,
  viz: a short but witty Motto or Word, answerable to the Picture, not too obscure,
  nor too plain. Best of all all hemistich of some different Language. Emblems require
  as well an artificious hand of either a Painter or Engraver, as likewise a quibbling
  Brain of a Word-measuring Poet - Retoribus atque Poëtes, Quid libet audendi semper
  fuit [ae]qua potestas -- /'
contents: 'And whereas Examples everywhere prevail above Precepts, I under the following
  heads viz: 1 the Whole World. 2. the Heaven. 3. Sun, Moon and Stars. 4. the Air
  & Etherial regions. 5. the Fire. 6. the Water, Rivers, Fountains. &c. 7. the Earth.
  8. Mortals & Minerals. 9. Stones, Jewels, Pearls. &c. 10. Trees & Shrubs with 11.
  the Several Fruits thereof. 12. Herbs & Flowers. 13. Fourfooted Creatures. 14. Birds,
  Fowls & all what flieth. 15. Fishes & Amphibious. 16. Serpents, Creeping Vermins
  & Insects. 17. Buildings, Gardens & what not. 18. Houshold Stuff. 19. Tools or Instruments.
  20. Clocks, Dials, hour-glasses. &c. 21. Weapons & things belonging to Carnal Warfare.
  22. Books. &c. &c. &c. 23. Man & Woman, as also 24. the several members of their
  Bodies. 25. Death & Funerals. 26. Histories either out of the Bible, or 27. Prophane
  Writers. / Shall Collect, or rather Recollect as many, as are not worm out of my
  Memory. Being once a Traveller in the World, mine eyes wandered about hither & thither,
  up & down, over & under, especially gazing on the painted Walls & Tombs of Great
  Men, falsely so esteemed. Luk. 18:19. and besides the following Emblems did observe
  several other Literal Plays and Ingenious Sports, ex: gr. / 1. Hieroglyphiks; or
  Egyptian Characters, used in stead of words; which all can not read. A child, an
  old man, an hawk, an hippopotamus & a crocodile we must spell thus. O ye that come
  into ye World, & goe out of it, God hates Impudence. / 2. Rebus; or Europian Hieroglyphiks,
  of a later date but of the same kind; an eye, a Loaf, a Rose, an Hill &c.will signify.
  I love Rose Hill well. / 3. Epitaphs; One that had employed many Doctors in his
  sickness, but all to no purpose, made himself this: Quod morbus non potuit, fecerunt
  Medici; Illorum turba me peremit. Multorum aunilio opporesus sum. vide sup. p. 11.
  / 4. Inscriptions; especially over Sun-dials. Ut radius, sie vita fluit, dum stare
  videtur. Our days upon earth are a Shadow. Job 8:9. Psal. 144:4. Eccles. 8:13. vide
  sup. p 3. [.] Over a School-door: Hoec domus est Christo Studÿsg-, dicata Inverboe;
  Nemo sacrum videt, dedecoretue locum. / 5. Posies; as, of a Ring: Ornat honoris
  Onus. or Decus virtute meredum. / 6. Symboles; as that of Leopold the First, now
  German Emperour: Consilio & Industrà. of the Royal Society in Englanf: Nullins in
  verba. Caspar Schwenckfels Nil Christo triste recepto. / 7. Anagram[m]s; or Disolutions
  of words into their elements; this transpose of letters prophetically promised that
  James Stuart would be a Just Master. / But I must not enlarge beyong mine own intention,
  & tell you of other fine Poetical knaks as Eacch''s, Achrostiches, Serpentine Verses,
  Recurrents, Numerals, &c. -- which I saw not only in Print, but even upon Columns
  & Tables of marble. S for a conclusion of this (: as if it were a :) Preface I shall
  say no more; desiring only your answer to a syllogism, I remember was represented
  to my view in a glass-window of the Senate-house of Nurnberg, viz {Incuria est Vituperanda,
  / Consul N: est in Curiâ, / Ergo Consul N: est Vituperandus.}'
