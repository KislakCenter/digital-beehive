issue: The points of reference for "Seamster" and "to Sell" are not entirely clear,
  as there are no alphabetical entries for these terms. The Octavo Index indicates
  that 604 [to Sell] may be the earliest occurrence of this topic in the Numerical
  section of the Alvearium. The Octavo Index indicates that 861 [Seamster] might be
  the earliest occuring entry referencing "Seamster", but the page on which it would
  appear is missing from the manuscript.
