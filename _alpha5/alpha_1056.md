issue: The point of reference for "Timber" is not entirely clear, as there is no alphabetical
  entry for this term. The Octavo Index indicates that 798 [Timber] might the first
  relevant entry in the numerical section of the Alvearium, but the page on which
  it would appear is missing from the manuscript.
