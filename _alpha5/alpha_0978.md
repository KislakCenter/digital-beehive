issue: The point of reference for "Hear-say" is not entirely clear, as there is no
  alphabetical entry for this term. The Octavo Index indicates that 779 [Hear-say]
  may be the earliest occurrence of this topic in the Numerical section of the Alvearium,
  but the page on which it would appear is missing from the manuscript.
