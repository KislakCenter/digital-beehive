issue: The point of reference for "whole" is not entirely clear, as there is no alphabetical
  entry for this term. The Octavo Index indicates that 772 [Whole] may be the earliest
  occurrence of this topic in the Numerical section of the Alvearium, but the page
  on which it would appear is missing from the manuscript.
