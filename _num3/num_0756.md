issue: The point of reference for "Deputy" is not entirely clear, as there is no alphabetical
  entry for this term. The Octavo Index indicates that entry 752 may be the earliest
  occurrence of this topic in the Numerical section of the Alvearium, but the page
  on which it would appear is missing from the manuscript.
