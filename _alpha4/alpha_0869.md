issue: The points of reference for "Face"and "Form" are not entirely clear, as there
  are no alphabetical entries for these terms. The Octavo Index indicates that 762
  [Face] and 763 [Form] may be the earliest occurrences of these topics in the Numerical
  section of the Alvearium, but the page on which they would appear is missing from
  the manuscript.
