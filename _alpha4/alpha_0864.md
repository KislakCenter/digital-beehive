issue: The point of reference for "Neger" is not entirely clear, as there is no alphabetical
  entry for this term. The Octavo Index indicates that 382 [Neger] may be the earliest
  occurrence of this topic in the Numerical section of the Alvearium. It is also unclear
  as to whether or not "White" should be considered its own entry. Here we have annotated
  it as if it were so.
