pastorius_description: 'And whereas Examples everywhere prevail above Precepts, I
  under the following heads viz: 1 the Whole World. 2. the Heaven. 3. Sun, Moon and
  Stars. 4. the Air & Etherial regions. 5. the Fire. 6. the Water, Rivers, Fountains.
  &c. 7. the Earth. 8. Mortals & Minerals. 9. Stones, Jewels, Pearls. &c. 10. Trees
  & Shrubs with 11. the Several Fruits thereof. 12. Herbs & Flowers. 13. Fourfooted
  Creatures. 14. Birds, Fowls & all what flieth. 15. Fishes & Amphibious. 16. Serpents,
  Creeping Vermins & Insects. 17. Buildings, Gardens & what not. 18. Houshold Stuff.
  19. Tools or Instruments. 20. Clocks, Dials, hour-glasses. &c. 21. Weapons & things
  belonging to Carnal Warfare. 22. Books. &c. &c. &c. 23. Man & Woman, as also 24.
  the several members of their Bodies. 25. Death & Funerals. 26. Histories either
  out of the Bible, or 27. Prophane Writers. / Shall Collect, or rather Recollect
  as many, as are not worn out of my Memory. Being once a Traveller in the World,
  mine eyes wandered about hither & thither, up & down, over & under, especially gazing
  on the painted Walls & Tombs of Great Men, falsely so esteemed. Luk. 18:19. and
  besides the following Emblems did observe several other Literal Plays and Ingenious
  Sports, ex: gr. / 1. Hieroglyphiks; or Egyptian Characters, used in stead of words;
  which all can not read. A child, an old man, an hawk, an hippopotamus & a crocodile
  we must spell thus. O ye that come into ye World, & goe out of it, God hates Impudence.
  / 2. Rebus; or Europian Hieroglyphiks, of a later date but of the same kind; an
  eye, a Loaf, a Rose, an Hill &c.will signify. I love Rose Hill well. / 3. Epitaphs;
  One that had employed many Doctors in his sickness, but all to no purpose, made
  himself this: Quod morbus non potuit, fecerunt Medici; Illorum turba me peremit.
  Multorum aunilio opporesus sum. vide sup. p. 11. / 4. Inscriptions; especially over
  Sun-dials. Ut radius, sie vita fluit, dum stare videtur. Our days upon earth are
  a Shadow. Job 8:9. Psal. 144:4. Eccles. 8:13. vide sup. p 3. [.] Over a School-door:
  Hoec domus est Christo Studÿsg-, dicata Inverboe; Nemo sacrum videt, dedecoretue
  locum. / 5. Posies; as, of a Ring: Ornat honoris Onus. or Decus virtute meredum.
  / 6. Symboles; as that of Leopold the First, now German Emperour: Consilio & Industrà.
  of the Royal Society in Englanf: Nullins in verba. Caspar Schwenckfels Nil Christo
  triste recepto. / 7. Anagram[m]s; or Disolutions of words into their elements; this
  transpose of letters prophetically promised that James Stuart would be a Just Master.
  / But I must not enlarge beyong mine own intention, & tell you of other fine Poetical
  knaks as Eacch''s, Achrostiches, Serpentine Verses, Recurrents, Numerals, &c. --
  which I saw not only in Print, but even upon Columns & Tables of marble. S for a
  conclusion of this (: as if it were a :) Preface I shall say no more; desiring only
  your answer to a syllogism, I remember was represented to my view in a glass-window
  of the Senate-house of Nurnberg, viz {Incuria est Vituperanda, / Consul N: est in
  Curiâ, / Ergo Consul N: est Vituperandus.}'
