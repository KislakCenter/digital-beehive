pastorius_section_header: Francis Daniel Pastorius. His Hive or Bee-stock. Containing
  above two thousand little Honey-Combs; Begun in the Year 1696-- And continued for
  the use of his Children.
pastorius_description: 'After I had collected Two Volumes of delightful Proverbs,
  witty Sentences, wise and godly Sayings, Comprizing for the most part necessary
  & profitable Caveats, Advises, Doctrines & Instructions, out of many Authors of
  many minds & diferent Opinions, not only in my Mother Tongue, but likewise in the
  Low-Dutch, French, Italian and Latin -- which both Books in 4o. are still with me.
  For the better learning of the ENGLISH, and that my two sons (: who probably will
  never attain to the understanding of the said Languages :) might hereafter have
  some of their Fathers Steps, thereby to be guided to the same Diligence & Asiduity
  of Picking the BEST out of GOOD Writings, I endeavoured at Spare-times to make this
  present Hive on a Quire of fine Paper, which a Friend of mine [: Jacob Tellner :]
  departing for Eorope did give me, And when all over filled up with honey-combs,
  I was constrained to enlarge my Hive with more courser, homely or home-spun Stuff
  of the Country-Product. Thus I leave it for the Perusing of those for whom it was
  contrived in the first beginning thereof; Nevertheless If any other besides them
  should happen to be benefitted by these Miscellanies, it will not sad, but glad
  my heart. // Nam Rodesse dolo cu[e]nctis, nullig, Nocere: / Semper amare bonos,
  et tolerare malos. / F. D. P. / As for my performance herein I could heartily wish
  it might prove to all honest peoples good liking.'
