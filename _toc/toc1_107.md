pastorius_description: 'For as much as the Old Index, beginning formerly at this side,
  was not only too Compact, being pressed together in the narrow Bounds of three Pages,
  but also defective & without true Alphabetical Order, &c. I at the latter Renewal
  or Renovation of this Manuscript, (: whereof it is never like to have any more,
  having had enough already, :) thought it most Convenient & suitable to those hands
  that will ac-complish this Alvearium, to Remove the said unhandsom & vitious Table,
  by tearing the same, and prefix a better & Compleater at the very Entrance or Threshold
  of this Book, to which I refer the inquisitive Reader for his more satisfactory
  Content. And Whereas (: as Plinius saith, / Ingenuum est Fateri per Quos profeceris
  / I shall set down the several Authors, out of which this present Hive is collected.
  - / And ye (: John Samuel & Henry Pastorius, dear & well beloved Children! // At
  Leasure hours and Candle-light, / When Others play, or lose their Sight; / Read
  ye these Books, I here have set, / Or other good ones you can get; See pag. 375.
  376. 377. 378. 379. 380. / But where you meet an Asterisk * / Think that your Father,
  being brisk, / Perused them, and like a Bee, / From thence did gather what you see
  / In hoc Alveario, Favis multifario. / Non sibi, Sed vobis Mellificavit, Apis. /
  sive potius Apicula Germanopolitana. F. D. P. '
