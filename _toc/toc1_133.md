pastorius_description: 'It is with Poetry or Poesy just as with Tobacco, which Some
  Smoke and Other can''t brook; / Laudatur ab his, Culpatur ab illis, vide infr√† pag.
  83 Num. 167. / Whereas now in the few next ensuing Leaves the Reader will find a
  Miscellany of my sorty Rimes, / I would not have him think, that I made them with
  a purpose to be accounted a Poet, / No, by no means, Non tanto sum dignus honore;
  but only to try whether Versifying / and Turning of the Spooling-wheel were things
  Compatible at the same times. // On this side I shall set down, what''s alledg''d
  Pro- and Con-; Whereunto ye may add Alvear ipsum. sub tit. psalms poesie & poets,
  a. & num. 454. 1586. 1584. Verses 1585. Thymes & meeters, 1701. &c. '
