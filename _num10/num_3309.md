issue: This is an unusual entry, as the topic is a letter and the content is a list
  of lines beginning with that letter. This entry appears in a grid along with entries
  2336â€“2340. This is a blank entry. The entry number is not entirely clear, as there
  is no alphabetical entry for this term, so we have assigned this topic the same
  number as the entry to its left in the grid.
