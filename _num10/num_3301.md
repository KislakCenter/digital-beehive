issue: This is an unusual entry, as the topic is a letter and the content is a list
  of lines beginning with that letter. This entry appears in a grid along with entries
  2336â€“2340. This is a blank entry. The entry number is not entirely clear, so we
  have assigned this topic the same number as the entry to its left in the grid.
