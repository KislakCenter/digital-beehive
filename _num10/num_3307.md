  2336–2340.|This is an unusual entry, as the topic is a letter and the content is
  a list of lines beginning with that letter. This entry appears in a grid along with
  entries 2336–2340. The entry number is not entirely clear, as there is no alphabetical
  entry for this term, so we have assigned this topic the same number as the entry
  to its left in the grid.
