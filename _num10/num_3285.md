issue: This is an unusual entry, as the topic is a letter and the content is a list
  of lines beginning with that letter. Moreover, this entry is unusual because I and
  J were written interchangeably in Pastorius's period, and this entry includes words
  and phrases that we would begin with a J in the present (like James).
