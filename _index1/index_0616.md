issue: Pastorius writes 1581, but there is no reference to Chaucer in any entry for
  1581. The entry 1585, however, clearly references Chaucer.|It is not entirely clear
  whether this index entry is "Chaucer" or "Chauser," which were both spellings used
  in this period of the name of poet Geoffrey Chaucer. Also, the point of reference
  for entry 1581 is not entirely clear; neither topic in that entry is particularly
  relevant to Chaucer, but we have chosen to link 1581 [Errata's]. It is possible
  that Pastorius meant to refer to 1585 [Verses] in this index entry, as 1585 [Verses]
  mentions Chaucer.
