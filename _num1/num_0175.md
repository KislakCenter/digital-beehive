issue: The point of reference for "Hermaphrodite" is not entirely clear, as there
  is no alphabetical entry for this term. The Octavo Index indicates that entry 731
  might be the earliest occurrence of this topic in the numerical section of the Alvearium,
  but the page on which it would appear is missing from the manuscript.
