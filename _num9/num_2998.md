issue: A line from the middle of this entry connects to the following entry in the
  Alvearium, 2066 [Cowardly]. Also, the point of reference for "Pledge" is unclear.
  It is worth noting that the index entry for "pledge" contains only a cross-reference
  to the index entry for "pawn," and the index entry for "pawn" lists only the entry
  for "Pawn" in the alphabetical section of the Alvearium.
