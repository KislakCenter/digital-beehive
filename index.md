### Digital Beehive

The Digital Beehive is a web interface that serves as both a digital representation and host of digital tools for researching and working with Pastorius’s manuscript and its system of cross-referencing. This Early Modern form of pen-and-paper hyperlinking lends itself naturally to a web interface and becomes exceptionally more navigable and discoverable in digital form. In order to create such an interface, the Digital Beehive project employs a small team to both develop and utilize various protocols for creating data and metadata for each of these honey-combed entries, both replicating their physical presence in the actual manuscript as well as creating a dynamic interface that allows users to follow and aggregate Pastorius’s own system of cross-references. The Digital Beehive thus lies at the nexus of manuscript studies and digital humanities. Not quite an aggregated database nor a digital edition, this project pushes our understanding of the digital humanities in new directions, as our datasets ultimately serve to replicate, reveal, and share a hyperlinked data system developed by a single author in the Early Modern period in manuscript form. The project is continually guided by a central question: How do digital formats faithfully replicate pre-digital data systems?

Much like Pastorius's own "Bee-Hive," the Digital Beehive is a work in progress and will continue to grow and expand.
