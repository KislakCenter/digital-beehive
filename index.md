### Digital Beehive

Welcome to the Digital Beehive, an interactive resource for studying a commonplace book from late seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century Philadelphia.

Francis Daniel Pastorius began writing this manuscript in 1696 in Germantown, Pennsylvania, and he continued to expand it until his death in 1719. Pastorius was a German immigrant to America, a Lutheran Pietist and admirer of the Quaker faith, a friend of William Penn, and an early abolitionist. He was also an ecological thinker and a utopian planner who attempted to link the natural world to the world of humanism in which he had been trained.

Dedicated to his sons, the Beehive manuscript is a compendium and digest of knowledge including inscriptions; epitaphs; proverbs; poetry; Biblical citations; theological citations; quotations; a list of books he read or knew; copies of letters; and notes on science, useful herbs, and other plants.

The original, handwritten Beehive is in the [Kislak Center for Special Collections, Rare Books, and Manuscripts](https://www.library.upenn.edu/kislak) at University of Pennsylvania. But using this website, anybody can peruse, study, and teach this vast book. For a more comprehensive account of the manuscript and the uses of the website, please visit the project's [About page](https://kislakcenter.github.io/digital-beehive/about/).
